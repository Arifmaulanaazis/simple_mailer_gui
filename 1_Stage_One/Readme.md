# Simple Mailer - 1

This is my first application. It's very simple.

Features

- No SSL or TSL. Email is sent by unsecure link. This email is not encrypted, its contents are transmitted as plain, readable text. 
- Support SMTP Auth
- Sent email to smtp host using port default (25)
- Version 1.0

Test the application only on your LAN.

There's a method to check all entries must be filled before send the email or pressing the OK button.

You will get an error if trying to send email with unsecure link or your Internet Service Provider.
